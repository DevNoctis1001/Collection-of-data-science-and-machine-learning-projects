## [TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game - Project](https://github.com/ptyadana/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Projects-Dojo/tree/master/Project%20-%20TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game)
Analyzing [Superbowls](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/684) data and answering questions like
+ What are the most extreme game outcomes?
+ How does the game affect television viewership?
+ How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
+ Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
* Project Tasks includes:
* TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game
* Taking note of dataset issues
* Combined points distribution
* Point difference distribution
* Do blowouts translate to lost viewers?
* Viewership and the ad industry over time
* Halftime shows weren't always this great
