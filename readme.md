# Data Science and Machine Learning Dojo

Collections of data science projects and dojo where I practice Data Science and Machine Learning related theories, probability, statistics and other skills.

## [TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game - Project](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/684)
Analyzing Superbowls data and answering questions like
+ What are the most extreme game outcomes?
+ How does the game affect television viewership?
+ How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
+ Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
* Project Tasks includes:
* TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game
* Taking note of dataset issues
* Combined points distribution
* Point difference distribution
* Do blowouts translate to lost viewers?
* Viewership and the ad industry over time
* Halftime shows weren't always this great
* Who has the most halftime show appearances?
* Who performed the most songs in a halftime show?
* Conclusion
